The One Million Developers is a do-ocracy.

### Do-Ocracy

Due to the nature of decentralization and distributed systems, it's difficult (perhaps impossible) to effectively grow and nurture all potential opportunities. Thus the One Million Developers initiative has taken the organizational structure of a do-ocracy.

> an organizational structure in which individuals choose roles and tasks for themselves and execute them.

We need a Code of Conduct to ensure the initive continues to be an environment everyone is able to contribute in.

Can you help write the Code of Conduct?
