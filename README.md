# Stewards

The One Million Developers is a do-ocracy.

### Do-Ocracy

Due to the nature of decentralization and distributed systems, it's difficult (perhaps impossible) to effectively grow and nurture all potential opportunities. Thus the One Million Developers initiative has taken the organizational structure of a do-ocracy.

> an organizational structure in which individuals choose roles and tasks for themselves and execute them.

### Code of Conduct

We need a Code of Conduct to ensure the initive continues to be an environment everyone is able to contribute in.

Can you help write the Code of Conduct?

Create a pull request or reach out to a Steward directly to get assistance with contributing.

In short, until a Code of Conduct is ready (and even then) treat others with respect, compassion and patience.

### Contributors

Every 30 days (effective Jan 1st, 2020) Contributors are expected to participate in the One Million Developers initiative.

Contribution Type(s)

- Create new issues in the Bounties, Ideas and other important repos.
- Add meaingful input to on-going discussions.
- Contribute Code to new or existing projects.
- Fund bounties and other essential tasks.

### Stewards

As of now Stewards are self-selecting and can be added via a pull request. Only a Contributor has the ability to remove a Steward.
