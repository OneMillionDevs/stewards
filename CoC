# 1MD Code of Conduct

Filename: 1MD_CODE_OF_CONDUCT.MD
Location: Root Repository
Purpose: This code outlines expectations for the One Million Developers' community of participants.


## Intent Statement

A primary goal of the One Million Developer's project within the Ethereum ecosystem is to be inclusive to the largest number of participating contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as stewards, contributors, and maintainers pledge to making participation in this project and the community a safe, accessible, supportive, and harassment-free experience for everyone.

One Million Developers is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of race, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, religion (or lack thereof), education, age, level of experience, socio-economic status, or other similar characteristic.

One Million Developers commits to prioritizing the safety of they who are marginalized over the comfort of they who are privileged.

## Contact Information

If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the One Million Developers Code of Conduct stewards team.


## Procedure for Incidents

### Reporting

You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible.

Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our community for everyone.

#### Anonymous Report
You can make an anonymous report here:
* https://onemilliondevs.wufoo.com/forms/z143wxhc161x74p/

We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

#### Personal Report
You can make a personal report by contacting via email:  
* onemilliondevs@gmail.com

When taking a personal report, we will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard.

We may involve other stewards or community members to ensure your report is managed properly.

Once safe, we will ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but it will be handled as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You will not be asked to confront anyone, and we will not tell anyone who you are to respect your rights to fundamental privacy.

### Enforcement

Community members asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the One Million Developers stewards may take any action they deem appropriate, including verbal and/or written warnings to the offender, temporary absense from participation, requirements to follow a conduct agreement outlining the process of returning to the community, long-term effective ostracism from the community, protecting the survivor, and informing any appropriate law enforcement.
